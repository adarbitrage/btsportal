name: Lifecycle email image qualification + token guard
description: How lifecycle email images are made Gmail-safe and how the raw-token bug was actually caused by a test script, not the template engine.

Absolute-image qualification lives in ONE helper (`qualifyPublicAssetUrl` in
`seed-templates.ts`), called by `renderPersonBlock` for staff/partner photos
and already present in `communication-service.ts::getCommonVariables` for the
logo. Both call sites need `portalUrl` (via `getPortalUrl()`) threaded in from
the real send path (`call-bookings.ts`, `scheduled-comms.ts`) — not just from
preview/test scripts. Root-relative stored paths (`/coaching-photos/x.png`)
get prefixed with the portal host; `/objects/...` paths and a missing portal
host both degrade to `null` (no `<img>`, initials-avatar fallback) rather than
a broken-image box.

**Why:** Gmail proxies every image and refuses relative/dev-host URLs, so a
missing seam here silently ships broken images to every real recipient.

**The "raw `{{token}}` in Gmail" bug was NOT a template/interpolation bug.**
The template and `replaceVariables()` were correct. The actual bug was that
`scripts/preview-emails.ts`'s real-send test call for `kickoff_call_reminder`
simply omitted `staff_name`/`call_date`/`call_time` from its `variables`
object — so the send-site variable *supply* was incomplete, not the render
engine.

**How to apply:** When a lifecycle email ships a raw token in production,
suspect the send-site variable-building code (real route handler AND any
preview/test script that exercises the same template) before touching
`replaceVariables` or the template string itself. A structural guard test
(`lifecycle-email-token-guard.test.ts`) now renders every lifecycle
slug×send-site variable set and fails on any leftover `{{`, but only catches
this class of bug if the guard's fixtures are kept in lockstep with the real
send-site variable-building code — mirror it, don't invent a superset.
