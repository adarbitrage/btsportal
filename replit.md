## BTS Member Portal

The main application is a customer member portal for "Build Test Scale" (BTS), an affiliate marketing mentorship platform.

### Authentication System

Custom email/password auth with:
- **Access tokens**: JWT in httpOnly cookies, 15-minute expiry
- **Refresh tokens**: Random 48-byte tokens, SHA-256 hashed in `sessions` table, 7-day expiry, rotation on refresh
- **Password hashing**: bcryptjs with 12 rounds
- **Account lockout**: 5 failed attempts = 15-minute lockout
- **Email verification**: Token-based (logged to console in dev)
- **Password reset**: Token-based with 1-hour expiry (logged to console in dev)
- **CSRF**: Token in non-httpOnly cookie for client-side access

**Auth middleware** (`artifacts/api-server/src/middleware/auth.ts`): Verifies JWT from `access_token` cookie, sets `req.userId` and `req.userEmail`. Public paths bypass auth.

**Auth routes** (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/auth.ts`):
- `POST /auth/register` — Create account (validates email, password strength)
- `POST /auth/login` — Login with lockout protection
- `POST /auth/refresh` — Rotate refresh token, issue new access token
- `POST /auth/logout` — Revoke session, clear cookies
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` — Request password reset (always returns success)
- `POST /auth/reset-password` — Reset with token
- `POST /auth/verify-email` — Verify email with token
- `GET /auth/me` — Current authenticated user

**Frontend auth** (`artifacts/portal/src/lib/auth.tsx`): AuthProvider with login/register/logout/refreshAuth. Protected routes redirect to `/login`. Guest routes redirect authenticated users to `/`.

### Product-Based Entitlement System

The portal uses a **product-based entitlement model** (not simple tiers). Users purchase products, each product grants a set of entitlement keys, and access is determined by the union of all active entitlements.

**8 Products:**
1. Reserve Income System (front-end) — `content:frontend`, `support:basic`, `chat:basic`
2. Backroad System (front-end) — `content:frontend`, `support:basic`, `chat:basic`
3. Off-Market Affiliate System (front-end) — `content:frontend`, `support:basic`, `chat:basic`
4. BTS LaunchPad (back-end) — `content:frontend`, `content:advanced`, `software:base`, `support:standard`, `chat:full`
5. 3-Month Mentorship — adds `coaching:group`, `community:access`, `commissions:entry`, `support:enhanced`
6. 6-Month Mentorship — adds `coaching:mastermind`, `software:expanded`, `commissions:mid`, `support:unlimited`
7. 1-Year Mentorship — adds `coaching:one_on_one:monthly`, `commissions:premium`
8. Lifetime Mentorship — adds `coaching:one_on_one:weekly`, `commissions:top`, `support:vip`, `chat:custom`, `access:lifetime`

**Entitlement resolution:** `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/entitlements.ts` — loads user's active products, unions their entitlement keys, and provides helpers (`getUserEntitlements`, `hasEntitlement`, `getHighestProductLabel`, `getSupportTicketLimit`).

### Pages
- **Login** (`/login`) — Email/password sign in with BTS branding
- **Register** (`/register`) — Account creation with password validation
- **Forgot Password** (`/forgot-password`) — Password reset request
- **Onboarding** (`/onboarding/*`) — 5-step wizard (welcome, documents, profile, orientation, quick-start)
- **Dashboard** (`/`) — Welcome banner with product badge, stats cards, training progress, upcoming calls, entitlement display, announcements
- **Training Library** (`/training`) — Tracks with locked/unlocked state based on `requiredEntitlement`, modules with progress
- **Community Feed** (`/community`) — Categorized post feed with reactions, comments, new post composer; gated by `community:access` entitlement
- **Member Directory** (`/community/members`) — Searchable/filterable grid of community members
- **Member Profile** (`/community/members/:userId`) — Member profile with stats, badges, and recent posts
- **Coaching Calls** (`/coaching`) — Calls gated by entitlement (coaching:group, coaching:mastermind, etc.)
- **Support Center** (`/support`) — Ticket management with entitlement-based limits

### Community Frontend (UI Layer)

The community frontend is a UI layer built for integration with community backend API endpoints (`/api/community/*`). It uses a custom fetch-based API layer (`src/lib/community-api.ts`) with React Query hooks (`src/hooks/use-community.ts`), since the community backend routes are not yet in the OpenAPI spec.

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/community-api.ts` — API client with typed interfaces for all community endpoints
- `src/hooks/use-community.ts` — React Query hooks with infinite scroll, optimistic reaction updates
- `src/pages/community/CommunityFeed.tsx` — Main feed with category tabs, pinned posts, pagination
- `src/pages/community/MemberDirectory.tsx` — Member grid with search, tier filter, sort
- `src/pages/community/MemberProfile.tsx` — Individual member profile page
- `src/components/community/PostCard.tsx` — Post cards with markdown rendering, reactions, edit/delete
- `src/components/community/CommentThread.tsx` — Comment threads with replies, inline input, edit/delete
- `src/components/community/NewPostModal.tsx` — Post composer modal with category, markdown, image URL
- `src/components/community/NotificationBell.tsx` — Bell dropdown with notification list, mark-all-read
- `src/components/community/TierBadge.tsx` — Tier badge colors and engagement badge components
- `src/components/community/ProfilePopover.tsx` — Hover/click profile card popover, AuthorAvatar
- `src/components/community/MemberCard.tsx` — Member card for directory grid

**Expected backend endpoints:** `GET/POST /community/posts`, `GET/POST /community/posts/:id/comments`, `POST /community/reactions`, `GET /community/categories`, `GET /community/members`, `GET /community/members/:id`, `GET /community/notifications`, `POST /community/notifications/read`

### Design
- Primary brand color: BTS blue (#1a56db)
- Background: warm off-white (#faf9f7)
- Font: Roboto (modern sans-serif)
- Editorial card layout with warm borders (#e8e4dc)
- Product badge colors: Frontend=#6b7280, LaunchPad=#92400e, 3-Month=#b45309, 6-Month=#d97706, 1-Year=#0891b2, Lifetime=purple gradient

### Database Tables
- `users` — Member profiles with auth fields, onboarding state (`onboarding_complete`, `onboarding_step`, `experience_level`, `primary_goal`, `sms_opt_in`)

### Onboarding Flow

New members (`onboarding_complete === false`) are redirected to a 5-step onboarding wizard:
1. **Welcome** (`/onboarding/welcome`) — Personalized greeting, product list, optional welcome video
2. **Documents** (`/onboarding/documents`) — Scroll-enforced Membership Agreement + Terms of Service with typed signature
3. **Profile** (`/onboarding/profile`) — Name, phone, timezone (auto-detected), experience level, primary goal, SMS opt-in
4. **Orientation** (`/onboarding/orientation`) — Dynamic display of owned entitlements vs. upgrade options
5. **Quick Start** (`/onboarding/quick-start`) — Product-tier-specific first mission, quick links preview, "Go to My Dashboard" button

Progress is saved per step (`onboarding_step` column). Server-side validates prerequisites (docs must be signed before step 2 advances, profile fields required before step 3). Step 5 completion sets `onboarding_complete = true`.

**Out of scope (TODO placeholders):** PDF generation, SendGrid email delivery, canvas signature, GHL contact sync, admin panel for document editing.

## TypeScript & Composite Projects

Every package extends `tsconfig.base.json` which sets `composite: true`. The root `tsconfig.json` lists all packages as project references. This means:

- **Always typecheck from the root** — run `pnpm run typecheck`
- **`emitDeclarationOnly`** — we only emit `.d.ts` files during typecheck
- **Project references** — when package A depends on package B, A's `tsconfig.json` must list B in its `references` array

## Root Scripts

- `pnpm run build` — runs `typecheck` first, then recursively runs `build` in all packages
- `pnpm run typecheck` — runs `tsc --build --emitDeclarationOnly`

## Packages
