## BTS Member Portal

The main application is a customer member portal for "Build Test Scale" (BTS), an affiliate marketing mentorship platform.

### Authentication System

Custom email/password auth with:
- **Access tokens**: JWT in httpOnly cookies, 15-minute expiry
- **Refresh tokens**: Random 48-byte tokens, SHA-256 hashed in `sessions` table, 7-day expiry, rotation on refresh
- **Password hashing**: bcryptjs with 12 rounds
- **Account lockout**: 5 failed attempts = 15-minute lockout
- **Email verification**: Token-based (logged to console in dev)
- **Password reset**: Token-based with 1-hour expiry (logged to console in dev)
- **CSRF**: Token in non-httpOnly cookie for client-side access

**Auth middleware** (`artifacts/api-server/src/middleware/auth.ts`): Verifies JWT from `access_token` cookie OR `Authorization: Bearer bts_...` API key header. Sets `req.userId`, `req.userEmail`, and optionally `req.apiKeyContext`. Public paths bypass auth.

**API Key Auth**: Keys follow format `bts_{environment}_{type}_{random}` (e.g., `bts_live_sk_a1b2c3...`). Two types: `secret` (full access) and `publishable` (read-only). Key is shown once at creation, stored as bcrypt hash. Supports granular permissions (`members:read`, `training:write`, `*`, etc.) and rate limit tiers.

**Request ID**: Every API request gets a UUID v4 `requestId` via `X-Request-Id` header (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/api-errors.ts`).

**Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed sliding window per API key prefix (`artifacts/api-server/src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts`). Response headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `X-RateLimit-Tier`.

**API Request Logging**: API key requests logged to `api_request_log` table (`artifacts/api-server/src/middleware/api-request-logger.ts`).

**Permissions**: Granular `{resource}:{action}` permission checking (`artifacts/api-server/src/middleware/permissions.ts`). Usage: `requirePermission("members:read")`.

**Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination helper (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/pagination.ts`). Returns `{ data, pagination: { hasMore, nextCursor, previousCursor, total } }`.

**Auth routes** (`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/auth.ts`):
- `POST /auth/register` — Create account (validates email, password strength)
- `POST /auth/login` — Login with lockout protection
- `POST /auth/refresh` — Rotate refresh token, issue new access token
- `POST /auth/logout` — Revoke session, clear cookies
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` — Request password reset (always returns success)
- `POST /auth/reset-password` — Reset with token
- `POST /auth/verify-email` — Verify email with token
- `GET /auth/me` — Current authenticated user

**Frontend auth** (`artifacts/portal/src/lib/auth.tsx`): AuthProvider with login/register/logout/refreshAuth. Protected routes redirect to `/login`. Guest routes redirect authenticated users to `/`.

### Product-Based Entitlement System

The portal uses a **product-based entitlement model** (not simple tiers). Users purchase products, each product grants a set of entitlement keys, and access is determined by the union of all active entitlements.

**8 Products:**
1. Reserve Income System (front-end) — `content:frontend`, `support:basic`, `chat:basic`
2. Backroad System (front-end) — `content:frontend`, `support:basic`, `chat:basic`
3. Off-Market Affiliate System (front-end) — `content:frontend`, `support:basic`, `chat:basic`
4. BTS LaunchPad (back-end) — `content:frontend`, `content:advanced`, `software:base`, `support:standard`, `chat:full`
5. 3-Month Mentorship — adds `coaching:group`, `community:access`, `commissions:entry`, `support:enhanced`
6. 6-Month Mentorship — adds `coaching:mastermind`, `software:expanded`, `commissions:mid`, `support:unlimited`
7. 1-Year Mentorship — adds `coaching:one_on_one:monthly`, `commissions:premium`
8. Lifetime Mentorship — adds `coaching:one_on_one:weekly`, `commissions:top`, `support:vip`, `chat:custom`, `access:lifetime`

**Entitlement resolution:** `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/entitlements.ts` — loads user's active products, unions their entitlement keys, and provides helpers (`getUserEntitlements`, `hasEntitlement`, `getHighestProductLabel`, `getSupportTicketLimit`).

### Community Frontend (UI Layer)

The community frontend is a UI layer built for integration with community backend API endpoints (`/api/community/*`). It uses a custom fetch-based API layer (`src/lib/community-api.ts`) with React Query hooks (`src/hooks/use-community.ts`), since the community backend routes are not yet in the OpenAPI spec.

**Key files:**
- `src/lib/community-api.ts` — API client with typed interfaces for all community endpoints
- `src/hooks/use-community.ts` — React Query hooks with infinite scroll, optimistic reaction updates
- `src/pages/community/CommunityFeed.tsx` — Main feed with category tabs, pinned posts, pagination
- `src/pages/community/MemberDirectory.tsx` — Member grid with search, tier filter, sort
- `src/pages/community/MemberProfile.tsx` — Individual member profile page
- `src/components/community/PostCard.tsx` — Post cards with markdown rendering, reactions, edit/delete
- `src/components/community/CommentThread.tsx` — Comment threads with replies, inline input, edit/delete
- `src/components/community/NewPostModal.tsx` — Post composer modal with category, markdown, image URL
- `src/components/community/NotificationBell.tsx` — Bell dropdown with notification list, mark-all-read
- `src/components/community/TierBadge.tsx` — Tier badge colors and engagement badge components
- `src/components/community/ProfilePopover.tsx` — Hover/click profile card popover, AuthorAvatar
- `src/components/community/MemberCard.tsx` — Member card for directory grid

**Expected backend endpoints:** `GET/POST /community/posts`, `GET/POST /community/posts/:id/comments`, `POST /community/reactions`, `GET /community/categories`, `GET /community/members`, `GET /community/members/:id`, `GET /community/notifications`, `POST /community/notifications/read`

### Admin Support Ticket UI

Admin-facing support ticket management pages accessible at `/admin/*` routes. All pages use a dedicated `AdminLayout` with its own sidebar navigation. Currently uses mock data (backend APIs pending).

**Pages:**
- `/admin/tickets` — Priority queue sorted by SLA urgency (breached > approaching > within), then VIP tier, then priority, then age. Color-coded rows (red/orange/green). Filters: status, category, agent, tier, SLA status. Bulk actions: assign, close, categorize with confirmation dialogs.

### Onboarding Flow

New members (`onboarding_complete === false`) are redirected to a 5-step onboarding wizard:

2. **Documents** (`/onboarding/documents`) — Scroll-enforced Membership Agreement + Terms of Service with typed signature
3. **Profile** (`/onboarding/profile`) — Name, phone, timezone (auto-detected), experience level, primary goal, SMS opt-in
4. **Orientation** (`/onboarding/orientation`) — Dynamic display of owned entitlements vs. upgrade options
5. **Quick Start** (`/onboarding/quick-start`) — Product-tier-specific first mission, quick links preview, "Go to My Dashboard" button

Progress is saved per step (`onboarding_step` column). Server-side validates prerequisites (docs must be signed before step 2 advances, profile fields required before step 3). Step 5 completion sets `onboarding_complete = true`.

**Out of scope (TODO placeholders):** PDF generation, canvas signature, admin panel for document editing.

### Commission System

The affiliate commission system lets mentorship members earn referral commissions. Key components:
- **Tier resolution**: `commissions:top` > `commissions:premium` > `commissions:mid` > `commissions:entry` (from entitlements)
- **Affiliate profiles**: Auto-created when a user gains a commission entitlement
- **Referral tracking**: `/go/:productSlug?ref=:code` sets a 30-day `bts_ref` cookie with 5-min IP dedup
- **Commission attribution**: ThriveCart `order.success` webhook checks for `bts_ref` in custom fields, resolves rate, creates pending commission
- **Refund reversal**: `order.refund` reverses pending/approved commissions for the order
- **Approval lifecycle**: pending → approved (after 30 days) → in_payout → paid
- **Fraud detection**: Self-referral rejection, same-domain email flagging, high-click-low-conversion flagging
- **Config env vars**: `BTS_REF_COOKIE_DAYS`, `CLICK_DEDUP_MINUTES`, `COMMISSION_APPROVAL_DAYS`, `PAYOUT_THRESHOLD_CENTS`
- **Key files**: `lib/db/src/schema/affiliate-profiles.ts`, `commission-rates.ts`, `referral-links.ts`, `referral-clicks.ts`, `commissions.ts`, `commission-payouts.ts`, `affiliate-resources.ts`, `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/commissions.ts`, `routes/commissions.ts`, `routes/admin-commissions.ts`, `routes/referral-redirect.ts`

### Communications Infrastructure

Central communication system using SendGrid (email) and Twilio (SMS) with BullMQ queue processing.

**Key files:**
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/communication-service.ts` — Central `CommunicationService` with `queueEmail`, `queueSms`, `sendEmailNow`, `queueBroadcastEmail`
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/communication-worker.ts` — BullMQ workers for async email/SMS processing (3 retries, exponential backoff)
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/redis.ts` — Redis/IORedis connection management
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/seed-templates.ts` — Seeds 28 email templates (16 transactional + 12 marketing) + 7 SMS templates
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/communication-webhooks.ts` — SendGrid/Twilio event webhooks
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/email.ts` — Unsubscribe/resubscribe endpoints
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/member-communications.ts` — Member communication history
- `lib/db/src/schema/communications.ts` — Drizzle schema for all communication tables

**Environment variables (required for real sends):**
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` — SendGrid API key
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` — Twilio credentials
- `REDIS_URL` — Redis connection URL (required for BullMQ workers)
- `FROM_EMAIL_TRANSACTIONAL` — Transactional email from address (default: noreply@buildtestscale.com)
- `FROM_EMAIL_MARKETING` — Marketing email from address (default: team@buildtestscale.com)
- `PORTAL_URL` — Portal base URL for links in emails
- `UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET` — HMAC secret for unsubscribe token generation

**Behavior without env vars:** All email/SMS calls gracefully skip sending and log to console. BullMQ workers only start if `REDIS_URL` is set. The system falls back to direct sends if Redis/BullMQ is unavailable.

**Template variable syntax:** `{{variable_name}}` — Common vars: `member_name`, `portal_url`, `support_email`, `company_name`, `current_year`

**Bounce handling:** Hard bounce → immediate suppression. Soft bounce → suppress after 3 in 7 days. All marketing sends check suppression before sending.

## TypeScript & Composite Projects

Every package extends `tsconfig.base.json` which sets `composite: true`. The root `tsconfig.json` lists all packages as project references. This means:

- **Always typecheck from the root** — run `pnpm run typecheck`
- **`emitDeclarationOnly`** — we only emit `.d.ts` files during typecheck
- **Project references** — when package A depends on package B, A's `tsconfig.json` must list B in its `references` array

## Root Scripts

- `pnpm run build` — runs `typecheck` first, then recursively runs `build` in all packages
- `pnpm run typecheck` — runs `tsc --build --emitDeclarationOnly`
